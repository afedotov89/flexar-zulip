// Pure reducers for the users store (Phase 1.3).
//
// The users store holds the organization's user directory keyed by
// `user_id`. It is hydrated from the register snapshot's `realm_users`
// array and then folded forward by `realm_user` events:
//
//   - `op: "add"`    — a new user joined, or a guest gained access to
//                      one. `person` is a full `User`.
//   - `op: "remove"` — a user was deactivated, or a guest lost access.
//                      `person` carries only `user_id` + `full_name`.
//                      We drop the entry from the directory.
//   - `op: "update"` — a property of an existing user changed.
//                      `person` is a partial `User` with a required
//                      `user_id`; we shallow-merge it onto the entry.
//
// `UserDirectory` is a plain `Record` keyed by id — the natural shape
// for the read-path UI, which looks users up by id (message senders,
// subscriber lists, presence rows). Reducers are pure: they return a
// new record and never mutate the input, so the store's `setState`
// triggers re-renders correctly.
//
// Note on `realm_users` shape: the register response omits the
// `is_active` field from `realm_users` entries (the API guarantees
// every entry is an active account). The domain `User` type requires
// `is_active`, so `directoryFromInitialState` fills it in as `true`.
// This is flagged for the orchestrator — it is a genuine mismatch
// between the frozen `User` type and the register payload.
